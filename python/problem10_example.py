Problem07: pandas filtering && group_by

Step
1. Get data from url
2. Delete Unnamed columns
3. Get unique value of "State", "Gender"
4. Get a sum by Gender, State.
5. Filtering with one condition
    5.1 condition => Gender = "F"
    5.2 get number of rows group by state with condition
6. Filtering with Regex
    6.1 condition => second alphabet of name is e
7. Filtering with multiple conditions
    7.1 condition => second alphabet of name is e && State = WA
